# FNChallengeList
Displays a list of challenges for a certain game. Challenges can be set completed or not.

I made this little while back before challenges were displayed in game. Challenges still are not fully displayed in game so this app may 
find some use yet.

I made this to learn more so it's definitely not perfect and there are a lot of TODOs spread around the code. First time using a lot of the
components in the app and first time creating an API.

I used node.js json-server to create a quick fake API to test with so the API used was kind of lackluster.  API calls are built around it
so not the most robust.

json_sample.json has the test file used for json-server creation.

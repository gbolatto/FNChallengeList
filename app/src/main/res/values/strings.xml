        \n\nIf this is your first time running the app, it will need an internet connection to get the
        initial data off of the server and then to update future challenges as they come out.
        \n\nIf this is not your first time, try reinstalling the application.  Unfortunately you
        will lose your completions doing this, however. This is because we do not store or save
        any data for the app remotely.
